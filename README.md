# circuitpython-multiflash
Automated CircuitPython concurrent board flasher

## Notes

This project is a working POC.
It still can run into edge cases where a board doesn't get flashed.

Requires a contents/ directory with the code and libraries to flash.

# TODOs

- Only MacOS Montery tested
- Linux supported
- Command line arguments
- Support more boards
- Automated latest firmware fetch from circuitpython.org
- Make status scripts be board-specific instead of hardcoded
- etc.
